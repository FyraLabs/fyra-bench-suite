# Cappy's Benchmark Suite

This fish script is a benchmark suite for Linux systems. It is created for benchmarking our Linux kernel builds and comparing them to other builds.

## Usage

You need to have the following programs installed:

- `fish`
- Steam
  - Portal
  - Half-Life 2: Lost Coast
- `gcc`
- `make`
- `cmake`
- `git`
...

The benchmark suite is run by executing the `bench.fish` script. This makes uses of the Phoronix Test Suite.
